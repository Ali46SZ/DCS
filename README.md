# DCS
Digital coordination System
 faculty of arts has fourteen departments. Students register their applications and these applications are classified manually and reviewed to coordinate them according to their degrees and department priority (i.e., ranked list). This task is more complex and consumes more efforts and even results are not accurate. As a result students in such colleges cannot start their education early. A lot of systems handle such problem e.g., tansik.com but for special cases like coordination of department within faculties it is not suitable. 
The proposed system which is called Digital Coordination System (DCS) solves this problem by developing new algorithms to coordinate students quickly and in accurate manner
Using DCS students can apply to their desired department by coordinating their departments in certain order to the DCS. Result of the coordination appears after we did the distribution 
the system consists of 
1- desktop part which the faculty is used for saving the data of students and make the distribution of students and exctract the reports of the sections 
2- the web part : the students register their desires and inquire about the results
